Also, if you think that the U.S.\ngovernment is hiding evidence of intelligent aliens\nthen you probably think that it is to protect the\npublic from panic. Neither of those aims is very\nsinister, but both views would count as conspiracy\ntheories; so, I'll leave the sinister purpose out of the\ndefinition.
